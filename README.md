# Project Title: **Arcade-Style 3D Third-Person Shooter**

## Project Description
This is an arcade-style 3D third-person shooter game built using Unity. Players compete for the highest score by surviving against waves of enemies, utilizing power-ups, and improving their shooting accuracy. The game combines fluid gameplay mechanics, strategic enemy spawning, and player-centric interactions to deliver an engaging and replayable experience.

## Key Features
- **Competitive Scoring**: The primary objective is to survive as long as possible and maximize your score, creating an addictive, replayable challenge.
- **Player Mechanics**: Smooth movement, customizable shooting mechanics (e.g., Gatling Gun, Shotgun), and integration of power-ups to enhance gameplay.
- **Enemies**: Diverse enemy types with unique health, movement, and attack behaviors.
- **Game Dynamics**: Real-time spawning system for enemies and power-ups, ensuring continuous engagement and replayability.
- **Visual & Audio Integration**: Utilized premade animations, character models, and particle effects from external asset libraries, effectively adapting and integrating these assets into the game environment.
- **Score Management**: High-score tracking system with clear feedback when a new record is achieved.
- **Game Over Logic**: Dynamic endgame flow with high-score updates and an automatic restart.

## Asset Usage
This project incorporates animations, character models, AI behaviors, and other assets sourced from Unity’s Asset Store and external libraries. While these assets were not created from scratch, the project demonstrates a strong ability to integrate and code these elements into a cohesive and fully functional game using Unity’s scripting capabilities.

## Setup Instructions
1. Clone the repository.
2. Open the project in Unity (version 2021.3.1f1 recommended).
3. Ensure all necessary build supports (e.g., Android, Windows) are installed.
4. Play the game within Unity or build it to a target platform.

## Learning Journey
- **Inspiration**: Inspired by classic arcade third-person shooters, focusing on dynamic gameplay and score-based competition.
- **Impact**: Provides an interactive and competitive gaming experience that encourages strategic thinking, hand-eye coordination, and replayability.
- **Technology Learned**: Mastered Unity NavMesh for AI pathfinding, Unity Animator for character animations, and advanced C# for game logic and mechanics.
- **Challenges**:
  - Integrating diverse power-ups seamlessly into the gameplay loop.
  - Balancing enemy spawning to maintain engaging difficulty levels.
  - Adapting and scripting premade assets while maintaining creative and technical ownership of the project.
- **Outcomes**: Gained a deeper understanding of game development workflows, real-time 3D systems, and the effective use of existing assets to build an original gaming experience.

## Screenshots & Demo
- Add in-game screenshots or GIFs showing player movement, shooting, and power-ups.
- Include a link to a gameplay demo or video if possible.

## Deployed Application
Provide a link to the built application, e.g., `.exe` for Windows, `.apk` for Android.
