# Survival Shooter

## Project Description
This is an arcade-style 3D third-person shooter game built using Unity. Players compete for the highest score by surviving against waves of enemies, utilizing power-ups and crowd control to stay alive. The game takes place in a thematic "nightmare" environment.

## Asset Usage
This project incorporates animations, models, and AI behaviors from Unityâ€™s Asset Store and external libraries (primarily pulling from a 3rd person shooter tutorial). While these assets were not created from scratch, integrating work from other locations allowed for faster development and produces a more polished end product.

## Key Features
- **Game Mechanics**: Waves of increasing difficulty spawn continuously so that no player can survive forever. At the same time, power-ups spawn in hidden set locations randomly, building up over time to give players an edge.
- **Player Mechanics**: Players are able to smoothly move across the map, directing enemies advancement towards them. Through mouse-clicks the player can aim and shoot killing enemies and increasing their score. 
- **Enemies**: 3 different enemy models with varying animations and 2 different stat blocks appear in-game. Enemy behavior is universally zombie-like pursuing after the player.
- **Power-Ups**: 3 different power ups allow the player to increase their damage, their fire rate, and their speed temporarily. 
- **Visuals and Audio**: The game uses high-quality premade models, animations, and particle effects to give a polished feel. Sounds and music were similarly sourced to prevent boring silent gameplay.
- **Arcade-Style**: After their health drops to zero, the player is given a score which is compared to the locally stored hi-score. Shortly after, the scene is reloaded and the player is given the opportunity to play again.
